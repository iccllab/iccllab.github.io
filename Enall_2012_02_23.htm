    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p> Due to the Internet fast progress in the information technology era, especially 

      in the twenty-fast century, the knowledge acquisition is dimensional and 

      quick to all the people demands around the Internet world. However, there 

      are some guys engage in wrongdoing in the Internet activities (Cyber5space). 

      They did the illegitimate behaviors, for instance, invading the other OS-systems 

      without getting the owners??permissions, planting the malicious programs 

      onto the disallowed directories in file systems and then to curb, infect, 

      and paralyze the system normal operations. Even steal(share) the software/hardware/else 

      resources have been authorized in the registered agencies via Internet channels. 

      In particular, the brute-force penetrating methods is probably made use 

      to retrieve illicitly the plaintext-message. Accordingly, a well-designed 

      crypto-mechanism is anxiously required to safeguard the system security 

      and document storage from all the illegitimate attempts.<br />

      Besides, we also pay attention to the studies of fast data searching, well-organized 

      data structure, high-performance data compression, and high-capacity/strong-robustness 

      information hiding (steganograpy/watermarking) on text/image embedding systems, 

      etc.<br />

      <br />

      Moreover, we wish to apply the explored techniques to reinforce police technology 

      in the face of new crime problems in the emerging information era. In other 

      words, the Law enforcement in Cyberspace issue with the security explorations 

      and information well-constructed engineering is the end we are going to.<br />

      <br />

      Now the Information Crypto and Construction Lab(ICCL for short) are located 

      on the second-floor of Information Building, Central Police University, 

      Taoyuan, Taiwan, 333. Our work team is made up of a professor (Dr. SHIUH-JENG 

      WANG) and a number of students (graduate/undergraduate) aiming at developing 

      efficient methodologies to hint the crime activities and seize computer-crime 

      suspects in the Cyberspace address. We would like to compass the ends in 

      hope of the most confidence.<br />
